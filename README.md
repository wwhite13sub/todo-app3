README.MD FILE IN ROOT PROJECT FOLDER

1. Name:  Wanda White

2. Overview/Description:  Project is to develop a website for TODO’s.  The site is to be used by anyone who is interested in a todo list and has three main pages.  1) The Home pages will display general information about the project such as project number, name, due date, objective and participants.  2) The todo list page will display a list of todo’s and allow the user to delete, mark complete, add new todo’s and selectively list all, active or completed todo’s. 3) The contact page will allow the user to enter first name, last name, email address and a comment and it will send an email. The site should have all functionality on both desktop and mobile devices and should be accessed via a hosting web site.

3. Details on how to use it or what functionality is offered:
a) Site users will access website via internet by entering site address.
b) On Home page, Site users can view high level project data that includes: project number, name, due date, objective and participants.  
c) On TODO list page, site users will be able to selectively view todo items (all, complete or active).
d) On TODO list page, site users will be able to mark an active todo as Complete and the list will immediately reflect the todo as Complete.
e) On TODO list page, site users will be able to delete any todo and the list will immediately reflect the deletion.  
f) On TODO list page, site users will be able to add a todo by entering todo description and assigned to and the list will immediately include the added todo.
g) On Contact page, site users will be able to enter first name, last name, email and comments and an email will be sent.  If any data is entered in one field, data must be entered into all fields.
h)  Site users will be able to do anything on mobile device that can be done on desktop. 

4. Technologies used:  React, Redux, React Router HTML, CSS custom rules, JavaScript, ESLint, Bootstrap, DesignIO, jQuery, GitHub,Mobile access, Chrome Browser, HOSTING SITE: https://accomplishtodo.netlify.app/
     

5. Ideas for future improvement:
a) Improve user experience by allowing user to establish a userid and password, and update only their own todo items.
b)  Improve user experience by allowing user to enter todo estimated completion date and actual completion date.
c) Improve user experience by allowing user to update a task description and assigned to person.  
d) Improve user experience by allowing multiple projects to be entered with associated todo items.
e) Improve user experience by establishing project manager role that can update any todos for his/her project.
f) Improve user experience by saving all data for a user from one login session to another.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
